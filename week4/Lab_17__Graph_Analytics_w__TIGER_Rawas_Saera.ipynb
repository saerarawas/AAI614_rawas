        "The study of network robustness is critical to the understanding of complex interconnected systems. For example, consider an example of a power grid network that is susceptible to both natural failures and targeted attacks. A natural failure occurs when a single power substation fails due to erosion of parts or natural disasters. However, when one substation fails, additional load is routed to alternative substations, potentially causing a series of cascading failures. Not all failures originate from natural causes, some come from targeted attacks, such as enemy states hacking into the grid to sabotage key equipment to maximally damage the operations of the electrical grid. A natural counterpart to network robustness is vulnerability, defined as measure of a network‚Äôs susceptibility to the dissemination of entities across the network, such as how quickly a virus spreads across a computer network.\n",
